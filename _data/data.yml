    summary: |
      Long time PHP and Laravel Developer, I fell in love with .NET Framework and .NET Core (now just .NET) during my time developing trouble 
      ticketing software for Telecom and Internet Provider Companies. Since then, I have used .NET from basic CMS type applications to creating plugins for established eCommerce solutions, such as NopCommerce and Umbraco.
